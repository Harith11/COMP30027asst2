# IMDB Movie Rating Prediction

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project for predicting IMDB movie ratings based on various movie features, including title, genre, actors, director, budget, and social media metrics. The project uses different machine learning algorithms to classify movies into one of five rating categories (0-4). 

The project involves feature engineering, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with performance measured using classification metrics. The goal is to build a robust model capable of accurately predicting ratings based on the provided dataset.

## Features
- Movie attributes like title, genre, budget, and cast
- Use of machine learning algorithms for classification
- Evaluation through accuracy and other classification metrics

## Deliverables
- **Report**: Detailed analysis of the dataset and models used (1,300-1,800 words).
- **Code**: Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Predictions**: Final predictions based on the model's performance.

This project is part of the COMP30027 Machine Learning course at the University of Melbourne (Semester 1, 2024).
